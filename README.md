# Odin Project Title - Game Library 

### Introduction.

https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library

### Project Setup

1. Set up project with skeleton HTML/CSS and JS files.

2. Book objects are going to be stored in a simple array, so add a function to the script (not the constructor) that can take user‚Äôs input. 

```javascript
let myLibrary = [];
```

Store the new book objects into an array.

```javascript
function Book(title, numPages, author, genre, year, read) {
  this.title = title;
  this.numPages = numPages;
  this.author = author;
  this.genre = genre;
  this.year = year;
  if(read){
    this.read = "Read";
  } else {
    this.read = "Unread";
  }
}
```

#### Object Constructors

Define specific type of object that you need to duplicate (i.e. title, author, year, etc) better way to create them is using an object constructor, which is a function that looks like above. 

**note: "read" object will have property of "read" or "unread".

```javascript
var newBook = new Book(title, numPages, author, genre, year, read)
```

and which we use by calling the function with the keyword new.

```javascript
function addBookToLibrary() {
  // do stuff here
}
```
